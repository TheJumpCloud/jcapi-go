        \ with some of our core features; otherwise known as Directory Objects. The\
        \ Directory Objects are:\n\n* Commands\n* Policies\n* Applications\n* Systems\n\
        * Users\n* User Groups\n* System Groups\n* Radius Servers\n* Directories:\
        \ Office 365, LDAP,G-Suite, Active Directory\n* Duo accounts and applications.\n\
        \nThe Directory Object is an important concept to understand in order to successfully\
        \ use JumpCloud APIs.\n\n### JumpCloud Graph\n\nWe've also introduced the\
        \ concept of the JumpCloud Graph along with  Directory Objects. The Graph\
        \ is a powerful aspect of our platform which will enable you to associate\
        \ objects with each other, or establish membership for certain objects to\
        \ become members of other objects.\n\nSpecific `GET` endpoints will allow\
        \ you to traverse the JumpCloud Graph to return all indirect and directly\
        \ bound objects in your organization.\n\n\n### JumpCloud Graph Model Example\n\
        \nThe diagram below highlights our association and membership model as it\
        \ relates to Directory Objects.\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jumpcloud-kb/Knowledge+Base+Photos/API+Docs/jumpcloud_graph.png\

        \n### Introduction\n\nJumpCloud System Context Authorization is an alternative\
        \ way to authenticate with a subset of JumpCloud's REST APIs. Using this method\
        \ a system can manage its information and resource associations, allowing\
        \ modern auto provisioning environments to scale as needed.\n\n**Note: The\
        \ following documentation applies to Linux Operating Systems only.**\n\n###\
        \ Supported Endpoints\n\nJumpCloud System Context Authorization can be used\
        \ in conjunction with Systems endpoints found in the V1 API and certain System\
        \ Group endpoints found in the v2 API.\n\n- A system may fetch, alter, and\
        \ delete metadata about itself, including manipulating a system's Group and\
        \ Systemuser associations,\n  - `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/systems/list-an-individual-system)\
        \ [`PUT`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/systems/update-a-system)\n- A system\
        \ may delete itself from your JumpCloud organization\n  - `/api/systems/{system_id}`\
        \ | [`DELETE`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/systems/delete-a-system)\n-\
        \ A system may fetch its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)\n\
        \  - `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/memberof` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/systems/list-a-systems-group-membership)\n\
        \  - `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/systems/list-associations-of-a-system)\n\
        \  - `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/users` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/systems/list-the-users-associated-with-a-system)\n\
        - A system may alter its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)\n\
        \  - `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/systems/manage-associations-of-a-system)\n\
        - A system may alter its System Group associations\n  - `/api/v2/systemgroups/{systemgroup_id}/members`\
        \ | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/system-groups/update-a-system-group)\n\
        \    - _NOTE_ If a system attempts to alter the system group membership of\
        \ a different system the request will be rejected\n\n\n### Response Codes\n\
        \nIf endpoints other than those described above are called using the System\
        \ Context API the server will return a `401` response.\n\n### Authentication\n\
        \nTo allow for secure access to our APIs, you must authenticate each API request.\n\
        JumpCloud System Context Authorization uses [HTTP Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00)\
        \ to authenticate API requests.\nThe HTTP Signatures sent with each request\
        \ are similar to the signatures used by the Amazon Web Services REST API.\n\
        To help with the request-signing process, we have provided an [example bash\
        \ script](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh).\
        \ This example API request simply requests the entire system record. You must\
        \ be root, or have permissions to access the contents of the `/opt/jc` directory\
        \ to generate a signature.\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of the example script,\
        \ with explanations.\n\nThe first thing the script does is extract the systemKey\
        \ from the JSON formatted `/opt/jc/jcagent.conf` file.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\
        \nconf=\"`cat /opt/jc/jcagent.conf`\"\nregex=\"systemKey\\\":\\\"(\\w+)\\\"\
        \"\n\nif [[ $conf =~ $regex ]] ; then\n  systemKey=\"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"\n\
        fi\n```\n\nThen the script retrieves the current date in the correct format.\n\
        \n```\nnow=`date -u \"+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT\"`;\n```\n\nNext we build\
        \ a signing string to demonstrate the expected signature format. The signed\
        \ string must consist of the [request-line](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-35)\
        \ and the date header, separated by a newline character.\n\n```\nsignstr=\"\
        GET /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\\ndate: ${now}\"\n```\n\nThe next step\
        \ is to calculate and apply the signature. This is a two-step process:\n\n\
        1. Create a signature from the signing string using the JumpCloud Agent private\
        \ key: ``printf \"$signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key``\n\
        1. Then Base64-encode the signature string and trim off the newline characters:\
        \ ``| openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\\n'``\n\nThe combined steps above result\
        \ in:\n\n```\nsignature=`printf \"$signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign\
        \ /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\\n'` ;\n```\n\nFinally,\
        \ we make sure the API call sending the signature has the same Authorization\
        \ and Date header values, HTTP method, and URL that were used in the signing\
        \ string.\n\n```\ncurl -iq \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H\
        \ \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Date: ${now}\" \\\n  -H \"\
        Authorization: Signature keyId=\\\"system/${systemKey}\\\",headers=\\\"request-line\
        \ date\\\",algorithm=\\\"rsa-sha256\\\",signature=\\\"${signature}\\\"\" \\\
        \n  --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}\n```\n\n\
        #### Input Data\n\nAll PUT and POST methods should use the HTTP Content-Type\
        \ header with a value of 'application/json'. PUT methods are used for updating\
        \ a record. POST methods are used to create a record.\n\nThe following example\
        \ demonstrates how to update the `displayName` of the system.\n\n```\nsignstr=\"\
        PUT /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\\ndate: ${now}\"\nsignature=`printf\
        \ \"$signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc\
        \ -e -a | tr -d '\\n'` ;\n\ncurl -iq \\\n  -d \"{\\\"displayName\\\" : \\\"\
        updated-system-name-1\\\"}\" \\\n  -X \"PUT\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
        \ \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Date: ${now}\" \\\n  -H\
        \ \"Authorization: Signature keyId=\\\"system/${systemKey}\\\",headers=\\\"\
        request-line date\\\",algorithm=\\\"rsa-sha256\\\",signature=\\\"${signature}\\\
        \"\" \\\n  --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}\n\
        ```\n\n\n#### Output Data\n\nAll results will be formatted as JSON.\n\nHere\
        \ is an abbreviated example of response output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"__v\": 0,\n\
        \  \"_id\": \"525ee96f52e144993e000015\",\n  \"agentServer\": \"lappy386\"\
        ,\n  \"agentVersion\": \"0.9.42\",\n  \"arch\": \"x86_64\",\n  \"connectionKey\"\
        : \"127.0.0.1_51812\",\n  \"displayName\": \"ubuntu-1204\",\n  \"firstContact\"\
        : \"2013-10-16T19:30:55.611Z\",\n  \"hostname\": \"ubuntu-1204\"\n  ...\n\
        ```\n\n\n### Additional Examples\n\n#### Signing Authentication Example\n\n\
        This example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to fetch the\
        \ JumpCloud record for this system.\n\n[SigningExample.sh](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh)\n\
        \n\n#### Shutdown Hook\n\nThis example demonstrates how to make authenticated\
        \ request on system shutdown.\nUsing an init.d script registered at run level\
        \ 0, you can call the System Context API as the system is shutting down.\n\
        \n[Instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
        \ is an example of an init.d script that only runs at system shutdown.\n\n\
        After customizing the [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
        \ script, you should install it on the system(s) running the JumpCloud agent...\n\
        \n1. Copy the modified [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
        \ to `/etc/init.d/instance-shutdown`\n2. On Ubuntu systems, run `update-rc.d\
        \ instance-shutdown defaults`. On RedHat/CentOS systems, run `chkconfig --add\
        \ instance-shutdown`\n\n\n### Third Party\n\n#### Chef Cookbooks\n\n[https://github.com/nshenry03/jumpcloud](https://github.com/nshenry03/jumpcloud)\n\

        \ are a multi-tenant Admin, you will automatically be routed to the Multi-Tenant\
        \ Admin Portal.\n2. From the Multi-Tenant Portal's primary navigation bar,\
        \ select the Organization you'd like to access.\n3. You will automatically\
        \ be routed to that Organization's Admin Console.\n4. Go to Settings in the\
        \ sub-tenant's primary navigation.\n5. You can obtain your Organization ID\
        \ below your Organization's Contact Information on the Settings page.\n\n\
        #### To Obtain All Organization IDs via the API\n\n1. You can make an API\
        \ request to this endpoint using the API key of your Primary Organization.\
        \  `https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/` This will return all\
        \ your managed organizations.\n\n#### Sample Request\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\n\
        \  https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/ \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
